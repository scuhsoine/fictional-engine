# X-Team 54 Style Guide
* Style guides are good for keeping code consistent through multiple team members who might have different coding styles

## Naming conventions

* interfaces, classes - UpperCamelCase 
* exception types - same as interface & class, have Exception at end of name
* fields, methods, parameters, local variables - camelCase
* instance & class constants - CONSTANT_CASE

## Commenting style for public and private members of a class or interface:

* use javadoc for most of comments, use // for comments within blocks of code to explain anything not obvious


* classes - have class header explaining general information
* fields - explain what field does if not obvious
* constructors - explain function of constructor and use @ tags to explain any parameters it takes
* methods - explain function of method, use @ tags to explain return, parameters, and any pre/post conditions of the method



## Coding style (brackets, horizontal, and vertical spacing)
* Tabs, not spaces
* Brackets are spaced by 1 space, not a new line
* use @ tags whenever possible (@Override, etc.)
* declare arrays in non-C style
* one line per variable declaration
* use uppercase L when using longs
