# X-Team 54 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
* We will assign and reassign through a group discord or through E-mail
* Discord link: https://discord.gg/6YBt288


## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
* We will post and pin important progress and add a commit to any repositories for the project
* Any followup discussion can be done through voice or text


## How will we communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
* Through voice on Discord (politely) or through E-mail if the problem is personal


## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
* We will communicate the deadlines and give stern but friendly reminders to team members that are not contributing enough
